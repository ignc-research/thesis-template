# Thesis-Project-Template IGNC - Technische Universität Berlin
This repository is here to orient the students who conduct a project (Studies on Computer Science, Computer Engineering (TI), Electrical Engineering, etc. ( Bachelor-, Semester-, and Master Theses) at the Industry Grade Networks & Clouds Chair at Teschniche Universität Berlin. It contains general information, guidelines, templates and helpful links.

## Organisation 
Bachelor and Master theses last 4-6 months, the official starting date is agreed on with the supervisor. Typically, the student is given time to get used to the environment and do literature research before registering the thesis.
Our 9CP Semester projects (IAS and VIS) last 18-20 weeks starting at the first day of the semester and end at the end of the semester. 

You will agree with your supervisor on a bi-weekly or weekly meeting. The meeting is meant to answer your questions and to check your progress. It is helpful for you to prepare these meetings with this [update-report-form.pdf](update-report-form.pdf).

## Thesis/report form
You are free to choose any template, style and design of your thesis/report as long as you follow the following points:

### Titlepage
* The titlepage must contain 
    * Title
    * The logos of TU Berlin and IGNC
    * Your Name
    * The Supervisors name
    * The first and second examinors name (for a thesis)
    * The date of submission (must be the same date that you submit the thesis!)

We recommend to use an overleaf template.
### Structure

### Presentation/Defense
The final presentation will take place at the end of the project. A test run is presented to and discussed with the supervisors 2–5 days before the public final presentation. It consists of 15-20 minutes for the actual presentation and 20-30 min of Q&A from the audience. 

Exact dates and times for the intermediate and final presentations will be arranged by the supervisor.
