\section{Data Overview}
Schematically, the observation and action data that will be recorded has the following format. The observations consist of a 360 degree laser scan with ranges from 0.0 to 3.5 meters and the position of the goal in polar coordinates in the robotâ€™s own coordinate frame. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:observation-space-scan}, the robot is only aware of portions of objects that are contained within a 3.5m radius, such as the circular dynamic obstacle and wall shown. If at a given angle no object is within the 3.5m range, a value of 3.5 is recorded. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:observation-space-goal}, the goal in the robot's coordinate frame is located at the transition of $\pi$ and $-\pi$ degrees.

 The actions consist of a linear velocity ranging from 0.0 meters per second to 0.3 meters per second and an angular velocity ranging from -2.7 meters per second to 2.7 meters per second, see figure \ref{fig:action-space}.
