\section{Data Generation}
In the data generation section of the conceptual design, there are three modules: expert, simulation and recording. As discussed above, the simulation environment is already implemented in arena-rosnav. The implementation of the expert and recording modules depends on the type of expert being recorded. The central problems to be solved in each case are implementing a control loop and synchronizing the observation data sources.
