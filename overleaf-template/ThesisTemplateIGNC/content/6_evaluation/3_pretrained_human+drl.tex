\section{Behavior Cloning with Human Expert Data}
The second experiment to accelerate DRL with behavior cloning used a dataset recorded from a human expert. A total of 384 episodes were recorded across all five training stages with a combined total of 57,332 timesteps. This took 4.5 hours for the human expert to record. In contrast to the MPC dataset, the episodes were recorded on map4. This map is smaller than map\_small and includes static obstacles.
