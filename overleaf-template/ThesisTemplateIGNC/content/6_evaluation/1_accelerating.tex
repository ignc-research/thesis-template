\section{Accelerating DRL Training with Behavior Cloning}
This section presents the results of experiments to accelerate DRL training runs by pretraining agents with behavior cloning. First the results of pretraining an agent with data recorded from MPC will be presented and then the results of pretraining an agent with data recorded from a human expert. As a baseline, the results of training an agent from scratch with random weights will also be presented.
